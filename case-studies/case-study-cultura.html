However, our ambitions were to create a strong foundation that embraced a rapidly evolving business and more diverse user base.</p><p class=readable--area>Our high level goals were to:</p><ul class=readable--area> <li>Make it standard and clear</li> <li>Give HR control over their time and money</li> <li>Create a platform for applicants management through job listings.</li> </ul><h3 class=readable--area>My Role</h3><p class=readable--area>I led the product design of the job creation experience between November 2021 and August 2022 and collaborated with four other developers, six HR specialists and conduct UX researches to validate the product.</p><h3 class=readable--area>Picking up the pieces</h3><p class=readable--area>At the outset of the project we didn’t have a clear mission or specific goals for the job listings creation and needs.

That's a matter of accuracy between companies and candidates.”</li> <li>”...

Later these words helped in the creation of DNA.</p><p class=readable--area>And again... Unfortunately I can't share the DNA resources, but I can show the final value proposition!</p><p class="readable--area quote-p-std"> "Transform the company's integration processes into something simplified, functional and adaptable for each independent team and create a routine for maintaining leadership relationships and alignment based on the company's culture through centralized technologies." </p><p class=readable--area>After defining the solution a search was made of competitors who resemble the delivery of project. When doing the benchmarking we did not identify direct competitors of the product, but some products and services were found to deliver similar goals but not in a connected and centralized way to solve this kind of problem.</p><h3 class=readable--area>Values &amp; Personalities</h3><p class=readable--area>Along with the Value Proposition Canvas, some words, personalities and values were raised that must somehow be represented in the solution. These are the values of the brand:</p><ul class=readable--area> <li>Integrated - It needs to be an integrated application, not only with the HubSpot platform, but also with the users' company, HR teams and the applicants themselves.</li> <li>Simple - It should be simple, clear, natural and objective in the process of managing the application and Job Listings in general.</li> <li>Dynamic - It should be dynamic, alive, always changing, bringing visual and functional feedback to managers without being intrusive.</li> <li>Natural/Fluid - The main dashboard of the application should be the managers' house, it should be something that is a natural process to navigate and make decisions.</li> <li>People First - It must have people and the human first, because it is an application managed by people in search of human characteristics. Not to be confused with automation.</li> </ul><p class=readable--area>And here are the personalities of the brand:</p><ul class=readable--area> <li>Accurate - It is an objective application, it brings what managers will need to automate the entire hiring/recruitment process.</li> <li>Friendly - A fundamentally friendly UI and UX to make navigation more indicative and easy to understand to pretty much everyone.</li> <li>Layered - The application as a whole is separated by layers or main branches that branch off, it is a design feature that in itself should maintain a consistency in the application in general.</li> <li>All-in-one - ATS Hub was made to be a main dashboard where the entire process must be manipulated and controlled, including bringing existing functions within the HubSpot platform itself.</li> </ul><h2 class=readable--area>Brand Positioning</h2><p class="readable--area quote-p-std"> "Nothing beats the feeling of working with what you like, with support, growth and transparency." </p><p class=readable--area>This is something we think everyone should experience in their day-to-day business. However, we know how the management and culture of companies can be big stones in the career plan and development of both the professional and the company, and also delicate. With that in mind, our project is to simplify and organize the way of carrying out onboarding processes, so that we can bring managers closer to the teams and maintain a healthy culture in the company on an ongoing basis.</p><h3 class=readable--area>Operational</h3><p class=readable--area>The creation of the conceptual panels (also known as Moodboard) helps in the development of the style and look of the brand. By transforming abstract attributes into images, we managed to translate the company's ideas into visual elements.</p></div><div class="standard-section full-img"><img alt="General project moodboard and audience reference" loading=lazy src=../static/images/MOODBOARD.webp></div><div class=text--zone><h3 class=readable--area>Logo Creation &amp; Concept</h3><p class=readable--area>Basically the logo is based on a layered process (inside Cultura Platform), also related to keeping the pace towards the ascension/progress. It also reminds a boat and a flag driving people towards a better Culture.</p><p class=readable--area>The logo contains the logomark and the wordmark. Both elements have been exactly positioned and proportionally fine-tuned.</p></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="UI test elements" loading=lazy src=../static/images/UI-test-brand.webp></div><div class=text--zone></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Logomark and wordmark concept" loading=lazy src=../static/images/LogoConcept.webp></div><div class=text--zone></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="UI app icons usage" loading=lazy src=../static/images/ICONS.webp></div><div class=text--zone><p class=readable--area>The color palette chosen for the brand reflects the values contained in the DNA. Colors with softer tones were selected to convey Cultura's care and approach.</p><p class=readable--area>Some mockups (these are just samples, there is more mockups, contact if you want to see them) were created to show how the logo would look in different situations:</p></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Stairs wall mockup." loading=lazy src=../static/images/Mock00.webp></div><div class=text--zone></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Subway entrance mockup." loading=lazy src=../static/images/Mock01.webp></div><div class=text--zone><h3 class=readable--area>UI Design</h3><p class=readable--area>After creating the branding, I started to formalize the UI of the current Cultura. Focusing on the dashboard model and separating Gated content from Ungated content, I used already known UI patterns and also used principles and results from previous UX researches. Cultura's audience is not technical but more used to industry standards, it is an audience focused on desktops and, depending on the company, more traditional.</p><p class=readable--area>With that in mind, the UI project was designed to be simple and intuitive, with a navigation structure that follows industry standards and is also intuitive for the user. The UI design was also designed to be responsive, but with a more traditional approach and for after the initial launch. By having meetings with stakeholders, Milestones, backup plans and frequency of sprints for the project were defined. The defined milestones always aimed to show relevant progress for stakeholders and also other employees of the company.</p><p class=readable--area>Then the Design System started to get a life!</p></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Design system CTAs and buttons" loading=lazy src=../static/images/DesignSystem00.webp></div><div class=text--zone></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Drop-downs, fields, radio buttons and checkboxes being featured" loading=lazy src=../static/images/DesignSystem01.webp></div><div class=text--zone></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Sign in interface sample" loading=lazy src=../static/images/Showcase-cultura-00.webp></div><div class=text--zone><h2 class=readable--area>Giving Hiring Managers Back Their Time!</h2><p class=readable--area>Knowing the hiring process steps and the most accurate understanding of their usual job pages creation allowed us to do the heavy lifting and design the most optimal centralized app for HR ops. The system needed to be smart enough to just work when it could, and humble enough to intervene when it couldn't. This system called adaptation was by far the most complex problem of this project.</p><p class=readable--area>I started working on simple flowcharts to get a view of the user journey:</p></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Hiring manager and Applicant flowchart" loading=lazy src=../static/images/Flowcharts.webp></div><div class=text--zone><h3 class=readable--area>Adaptation</h3><p class=readable--area>I designed the flow based on the idea of a process confidence score. If Cultura is confident of the Hiring Manager's current process/step, it does all the heavy lifting to get the most meaningful options. Otherwise, the app follows the standard path.</p><p class=readable--area>Usually the standard path looks like this:</p><ul class=readable--area> <li>Set forms to collect applicants data</li> <li>Create Job Page</li> <li>Review good practices and publish Job</li> <li>Review Applicants data and continue the flow with communication</li> <li>Move Applicant through the pipeline</li> <li>Make alignment meetings, agendas and more</li> </ul></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Figma prototype connections" loading=lazy src=../static/images/PrototypeConnections.jpg></div><div class=text--zone><h3 class=readable--area>Dashboard Process &amp; Ideas</h3><p class=readable--area>After the long and pleasant process of wireframing, low fidelity design and formalization of production materials - we decided to explore new horizons for Dark mode and expand the HubSpot's implementations for the CMS theme, thus creating the website and theme.</p></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Dashboard Job Listings in dark mode sample" loading=lazy src=../static/images/DARKMODE-SAMPLE.webp></div><div class=text--zone></div><div class="standard-section rounded-img-content"><img alt="Billing screen in half dark mode color set" loading=lazy src=../static/images/BILLING-SAMPLE.webp></div><div class=text--zone></div> <div class=text--zone> <h3 class=readable--area>HubSpot Theme Design</h3> <p class=readable--area> Theme creation was based on Dashboard's own Design System with obvious adaptations and improvements made for the web. After the decision of the stakeholders, the dark theme was taken as a priority and the light theme was left only to the Dashboard. </p> <p class=readable--area> After finishing the theme, the stakeholders allowed to make it open-source and also to publish a more "generalized" version in the HubSpot marketplace. Currently the theme is considered the flagship of Remotish Agency, it is a paid theme and because it is on the marketplace, I have developed a system to switch between Light and Dark for all our Marketplace customers in real time.
