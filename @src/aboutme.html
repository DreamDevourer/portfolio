                I‚Äôm Nicolas Mendes - a multi-disciplinary product designer who‚Äôs delivered creative and
                engaging
                solutions across web design, Front-end Development, UI/UX design research and mobile
                applications. I'm more introvert than extrovert, I really have found an appreciation for
                working
                remotely but still connecting with lots of people daily. Yet, I still prefer ‚Äúcameras off‚Äù
                most
                days so I can pace around the house - lol that works a lot to think about good solutions!

                flexible
                work and different challenges in a fast-paced, high tech environment.
