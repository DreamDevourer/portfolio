                    I‚Äôm Nicolas Mendes - a multi-disciplinary product designer who‚Äôs delivered creative and
                    engaging
                    solutions across web design, Front-end Development, UI/UX design research and mobile
                    applications. I'm more introvert than extrovert, I really have found an appreciation for
                    working
                    remotely but still connecting with lots of people daily. Yet, I still prefer ‚Äúcameras off‚Äù
                    most
                    days so I can pace around the house - lol that works a lot to think about good solutions!
