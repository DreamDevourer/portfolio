                    using Google Sign In, then experience automated creation of HubSpot forms for job pages (Main -&gt;
                    Forms), the users will be able to attach this form by using one of our HubSpot themes (Main -&gt; Job
                    Listings v1) (available in the marketplace) and see form submission results (Main -&gt; Applicants

                        with the users' company, HR teams and the applicants themselves.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Simple - It should be simple, clear, natural and objective in the process of managing the

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dynamic - It should be dynamic, alive, always changing, bringing visual and functional feedback to

                    <li>
                        Natural/Fluid - The main dashboard of the application should be the managers' house, it should be
                        something that is a natural process to navigate and make decisions.

                    <li>
                        People First - It must have people and the human first, because it is an application managed by
                        people in search of human characteristics. Not to be confused with automation.

                    <li>
                        Layered - The application as a whole is separated by layers or main branches that branch off, it is
                        a design feature that in itself should maintain a consistency in the application in general.

                <p class="readable--area">
                    After creating the branding, I started to formalize the UI of the current Cultura. Focusing on the
                    dashboard model and separating Gated content from Ungated content, I used already known UI patterns and
                    also used principles and results from previous UX researches. Cultura's audience is not technical but
                    more used to industry standards, it is an audience focused on desktops and, depending on the company,
                    more traditional.

                <p class="readable--area">
                    With that in mind, the UI project was designed to be simple and intuitive, with a navigation structure
                    that follows industry standards and is also intuitive for the user. The UI design was also designed to
                    be responsive, but with a more traditional approach and for after the initial launch. By having meetings
                    with stakeholders, Milestones, backup plans and frequency of sprints for the project were defined. The
                    defined milestones always aimed to show relevant progress for stakeholders and also other employees of
                    the company.

                    After the long and pleasant process of wireframing, low fidelity design and formalization of production
                    materials - we decided to explore new horizons for Dark mode and expand the HubSpot's implementations
                    for the CMS theme, thus creating the website and theme.

                <h3 class="readable--area">HubSpot Theme Design</h3>
                <p class="readable--area">
                    Theme creation was based on Dashboard's own Design System with obvious adaptations and improvements made
                    for the web. After the decision of the stakeholders, the dark theme was taken as a priority and the
                    light theme was left only to the Dashboard.
                </p>
                <p class="readable--area">
                    After finishing the theme, the stakeholders allowed to make it open-source and also to publish a more
                    "generalized" version in the HubSpot marketplace. Currently the theme is considered the flagship of
                    Remotish Agency, it is a paid theme and because it is on the marketplace, I have developed a system to
                    switch between Light and Dark for all our Marketplace customers in real time. Making the theme a totally
                    separate project from Cultura and currently self-sufficient.
                </p>
                <p class="readable--area">
                    The theme was changed a little bit to hide Cultura information and related stuff, since it should be
                    treated as a separated project, while still being part of Cultura.
